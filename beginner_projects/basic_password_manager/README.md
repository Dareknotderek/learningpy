## Password Generator and Storage
This is a simple Python script that generates strong, unique passwords and stores them in a text file.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
To use this script, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

#### Installing
No installation is required. Simply download the script and run it using Python 3.

#### Usage
To use the script, run it using Python 3 from the command line:

`python3 password_generator.py`

The script will prompt you to enter a username and the desired length of the password. It will then generate a random password of the specified length and save it to a file named `passwords.txt`. 
The password will be associated with the provided username in the file.

You can repeat this process as many times as you need to generate and store passwords for different usernames.

### Security Considerations
This script is meant to be a simple demonstration of how to generate and store strong, unique passwords using Python. 
It does not include any advanced security features like salting or hashing the passwords. 
Therefore, it should not be used in a production environment or to store sensitive data.

If you need to store passwords for real-world use, you should consider using a password manager or a more advanced solution that includes encryption and other security features.
