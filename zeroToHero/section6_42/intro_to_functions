## Intro Functions

Creating clean, repeatbale code is a key part of becoming an effective programmer. 

Functions allow us to create blocks of code that can be easily executed many times without needing to constatnly rewrite the entire block. 

They are a huge leap forward in the capabilities as a programmer. The problems will also be harder as a result. 

It's all about practicing the intersection of all the things learned thus far. Stackover flow and GPT can help bootstrap and overcome issues as they arise. 

This is when people typically get tilted. But we need to power through that. We're going to make a lot of mistakes. 

Our next notebook will get into actual code, but we just needed to remind ourselves to be patient, pratice, and do our best to enjoy the journey.
